This folder is for stuff I did for the project that was not directly related to the features I worked on.
 
Before this project, I had never used React or made a project this big with a front and back end. 
These files are part of what I did on my local machine throughout the project as practice to become familiar with the languages and technologies we were using for the real thing.
 
I followed tutorials from books and played around with the code to see what changing certain parts would do to the web page. 

The code is commented out in each file (sometimes multiple times as new ideas were introduced) so that it can be merged into main for grading and 
does not interfere with the code used in the project!
